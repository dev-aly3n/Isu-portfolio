This is a nextJS template.
Live: https://aly3n.vercel.app
 A real template that all you need is to follow these simple steps:


1.Fork this repository. then clone your forked repo and run this command to install dependencies: "npm install"

2.Run the app by this command: "npm run dev"
so you can see the live app at port 3000. open this address in your browser: https://localhost:3000

3.Now you just need to change 1 single file to change the entire project. no coding require.
just open and edit allData.ts file in this directory: root/src/store/allData.ts
-./
---src/
------store/
-----------/allData.ts

You also need to change the photos in the media folder at this directory:
-./
---public/
---------media/

don't forget to change the image's address to the new image's name in the allData.ts file to make it works.


4.go to https://vercel.com/ and sign-up. so you can simply follow the vercel guide and select your repo to deploy it and make it online.

5.please don't remove or change the copy-right sign at the bottom.
