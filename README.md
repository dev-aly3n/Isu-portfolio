<div>This is a nextJS template.</div>
<div>Live: https://aly3n.vercel.app</div>
<div>&nbsp;A real template that all you need is to follow these simple steps:</div>
<br /><br />
<div><strong>1.</strong>Fork this repository. then clone your forked repo and run this command to install dependencies: "npm install"</div>
<br />
<div><strong>2.</strong>Run the app by this command: "npm run dev"</div>
<div>so you can see the live app at port 3000. open this address in your browser: https://localhost:3000</div>
<br />
<div><strong>3.</strong>Now you just need to change 1 single file to change the entire project. no coding require.</div>
<div>just open and edit allData.ts file in this directory: root/src/store/allData.ts</div>
<div>-./</div>
<div>---src/</div>
<div>------store/</div>
<div>-----------/allData.ts</div>
<br />
<div>You also need to change the photos in the media folder at this directory:</div>
<div>-./</div>
<div>---public/</div>
<div>---------media/</div>
<br />
<div>don't forget to change the image's address to the new image's name in the allData.ts file to make it works.</div>
<br /><br />
<div><strong>4.</strong>go to https://vercel.com/ and sign-up. so you can simply follow the vercel guide and select your repo to deploy it and make it online.</div>
