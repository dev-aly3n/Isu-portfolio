      title: "Chapter Two: The Wish and The Failure",
      desc: " So it's all and this is what happened to very young Aly. he started dreaming about it and he tried to be a rocket boy but in Iran?! his place was more fucked up than Hoomer's town. He went to university and tried to start with cheaper stuff so made some water rocket. tried to improve them but you know what? he couldn't find a hand-pump that can survive in 20 bar pressure (about 20 times of atmosphere). yes I know you can't believe it. but it's true. why? because this country of mullahs has been boycotted. so Aly hadn't the stuff that his friend Julian bought from a store besides of his home at Germany. anyway he tried even cheaper, Aly create a magazine about Aerospace and named it ASPAD. He made a website with Joomla as he worked with it since he was 14 and a blogger who wrote about rockets and water rockets. he worked on it days and nights. he even set an interview with Hoomer Hickam that eventually hoomer answered his question very kindly. The website and magazine was so fine but you know free volunteering works in a country that falling to bottom of poverty is not working. so it's the time for new chapter.",

      title: "Chapter Three: Changing The Career ",
      desc: " He start thinking about coding. he searched for the job offers. Aly needed inspiring to start it. so he found it. inspired by growing of this industry and how creativity that he can put on it. so he started to learn. he learned html css and js from w3school. I know I know such a nice place for learning nothing. he wasted one year on w3school besides of his study of aerospace. but after a year he found out that there is better materials and started to learn from an iranian teacher and please let me bang my head against the wall. that was horrible. but one day he searched how to build a nav bar css js and he found a guy whose name was Dev Ed on Youtube. Aly loved his course and his talking English. so searched about this guy and found his courses about js. so he started learning again. working on his code for days and nights with ultimate creativity that he had. how ever he has so much problem and left the coding for days but he came back to continue and complete his project.",

      title: "Chapter Four: To be continued",
      desc: "After all Aly completed 8 creative project with different technologies that he learnt and he is still learning. But the most important thing that will happen in this chapter is finding a job. Yes Aly will find a nice job at this chapter.  He think that he is ready to work with a good team.",
